Read 297198007 BAM records:
  kept 226340026 primary alignments (78.8%), of which 114247683 reverse reads
  skipped 39954167 primary alignments with insufficient mapping qualities (13.9%)
  skipped 16381452 excessively soft-clipped primary alignments (5.7%)
  skipped 4377043 unmapped reads (1.5%)
  skipped some suboptimal (secondary/supplementary) alignment records

  Per-sample stats (details in 'gstacks.log.distribs'):
    read 9906600.2 records/sample (57375-23353988)
    kept 70.2%-77.2% of these

Built 183855 loci comprising 112092343 forward reads and 103422459 matching paired-end reads; mean insert length was 275.5 (sd: 81.3).
Removed 8669884 unpaired (forward) reads (7.7%); kept 103422459 read pairs in 171973 loci.
Removed 90326226 read pairs whose insert length had already been seen in the same sample as putative PCR duplicates (87.3%); kept 13096233 read pairs.

Genotyped 171973 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=6.4x, stdev=3.9x, min=1.1x, max=13.9x
  mean number of sites per locus: 361.6
  a consistent phasing was found for 156321 of out 184672 (84.6%) diploid loci needing phasing
