Read 294055314 BAM records:
  kept 182811148 primary alignments (63.7%), of which 89982268 reverse reads
  skipped 37723750 primary alignments with insufficient mapping qualities (13.1%)
  skipped 20347784 excessively soft-clipped primary alignments (7.1%)
  skipped 46170006 unmapped reads (16.1%)
  skipped some suboptimal (secondary/supplementary) alignment records

  Per-sample stats (details in 'gstacks.log.distribs'):
    read 9801843.8 records/sample (56926-23115315)
    kept 39.3%-64.5% of these

Built 53910 loci comprising 92828880 forward reads and 84925368 matching paired-end reads; mean insert length was 269.0 (sd: 73.0).
Removed 7903512 unpaired (forward) reads (8.5%); kept 84925368 read pairs in 51763 loci.
Removed 74744507 read pairs whose insert length had already been seen in the same sample as putative PCR duplicates (88.0%); kept 10180861 read pairs.

Genotyped 51763 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=7.6x, stdev=4.8x, min=1.1x, max=16.8x
  mean number of sites per locus: 421.0
  a consistent phasing was found for 123894 of out 159844 (77.5%) diploid loci needing phasing
